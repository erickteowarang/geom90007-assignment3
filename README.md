# GEOM90007 - Assignment 3 - Group Project 

The Melbourne City Guide is an interface which targets new tourists of Melbourne but can be used by anyone living in Melbourne  
to plan their visits with better ease and to account for a better holistic visiting experience.  
Our interface aims to provide a combination of information available to new tourists that best illustrates a snapshot of Melbourneâ€™s food culture  
thereby leading tourists to have a better experience while accounting for potential landmark visits or the need for amenities. 

This assignment was created for the purposes of assessment for the subject GEOM90007 at the University of Melbourne
